# Hyperparameters: How to tune my VQ-VAE?

The VQ-VAE has the following hyperparameters
1. Codebook size and embedding dimension (n_codes and embedding_dim)
2. Model capacity (n_hiddens and n_res_layers)
3. Downsampling strategy (downsample)
4. Loss balancing (codebook_beta and recon_loss_factor)
5. Optimization parameters (learning_rate, beta1, beta2)
6. Training parameters (batch_size, num_epochs)
7. Attention mechanism (n_head, attn_dropout)
8. Codebook update strategy (ema_decay)

Below is how you would tune these parameters based on the `recon_loss` and `commitment_loss` curves.
1. Monitor Key Metrics
- Track these metrics during training and validation:
    - Reconstruction Loss
    - Commitment Loss
    - Perplexity
2. Analyze Loss Curves
- Reconstruction Loss
    - High and not decreasing: Increase model capacity (n_hiddens, n_res_layers) or adjust learning rate.
    - Train decreasing, val stable: Potential overfitting. Reduce capacity or add regularization.
    - Both decreasing, val much higher: Increase batch_size or use data augmentation.
- Commitment Loss
    - Too high: Decrease codebook_beta.
    - Too low or unstable: Increase codebook_beta.
3. Balance Losses
- Adjust codebook_beta and recon_loss_factor to achieve a good balance between reconstruction and commitment losses.
4. Optimize Codebook Usage
- Monitor perplexity:
    - Low perplexity: Increase n_codes or decrease embedding_dim.
    - High perplexity: Decrease n_codes or increase embedding_dim.
5. Fine-tune Learning Dynamics
- Slow convergence: Increase learning_rate or adjust optimizer parameters.
- Unstable training: Decrease learning_rate or increase batch_size.
6. Address Overfitting
- If validation loss plateaus while training loss decreases:
    - Introduce dropout in encoder/decoder
    - Reduce model capacity
    - Increase batch_size or use data augmentation
7. Attention Mechanism
- Adjust n_head and attn_dropout in attention blocks for better long-range dependencies.
8. Codebook Update Strategy
- Fine-tune ema_decay for codebook stability and adaptation speed.
9. Downsampling Strategy
- Adjust downsample factors based on computational resources and required detail level.

Best Practices
- Make incremental changes to hyperparameters.
- Perform ablation studies, changing one parameter at a time.
- Consider using learning rate scheduling or cyclical learning rates.
- Regularly save checkpoints and log experiments for comparison.
