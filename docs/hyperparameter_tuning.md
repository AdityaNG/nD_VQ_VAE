# Hyperparameters: How to tune my VQ-VAE?

## Hyperparameters Overview

The VQ-VAE has several key hyperparameters:

Codebook size and embedding dimension (n_codes and embedding_dim), model capacity (n_hiddens and n_res_layers), downsampling strategy (downsample), loss balancing (codebook_beta and recon_loss_factor), optimization parameters (learning_rate, beta1, beta2), training parameters (batch_size, num_epochs), attention mechanism (n_head, attn_dropout), and codebook update strategy (ema_decay).

## Tuning Process

### Monitor Key Metrics

During training and validation, it's crucial to track reconstruction loss, commitment loss, and perplexity.

### Analyze Loss Curves

#### Reconstruction Loss

If the reconstruction loss is high and not decreasing, consider increasing model capacity (n_hiddens, n_res_layers) or adjusting the learning rate. When the training loss is decreasing but validation loss remains stable, it may indicate potential overfitting. In this case, reduce capacity or add regularization. If both training and validation losses are decreasing, but validation loss is much higher, try increasing batch_size or using data augmentation.

#### Commitment Loss

For high commitment loss, decrease codebook_beta. If it's too low or unstable, increase codebook_beta.

### Balance Losses

Adjust codebook_beta and recon_loss_factor to achieve a good balance between reconstruction and commitment losses.

### Optimize Codebook Usage

Monitor perplexity closely. Low perplexity suggests increasing n_codes or decreasing embedding_dim, while high perplexity indicates the need to decrease n_codes or increase embedding_dim.

### Fine-tune Learning Dynamics

For slow convergence, increase learning_rate or adjust optimizer parameters. If training is unstable, decrease learning_rate or increase batch_size.

### Address Overfitting

When validation loss plateaus while training loss decreases, consider introducing dropout in encoder/decoder, reducing model capacity, or increasing batch_size / using data augmentation.

### Attention Mechanism

Adjust n_head and attn_dropout in attention blocks to improve long-range dependencies.

### Codebook Update Strategy

Fine-tune ema_decay for optimal codebook stability and adaptation speed.

### Downsampling Strategy

Adjust downsample factors based on available computational resources and required detail level.

## Best Practices

Make incremental changes to hyperparameters and perform ablation studies, changing one parameter at a time. Consider using learning rate scheduling or cyclical learning rates. Regularly save checkpoints and log experiments for comparison.
